        <p>
          Pong is a sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls
          an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right
          side of the screen. They can compete against another player
          controlling a second paddle on the opposing side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for
          each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are
          earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
        </p>
